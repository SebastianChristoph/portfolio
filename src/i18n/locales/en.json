    "paragraph1": "As a Full Stack Developer, I love working across the stack — because why pick just frontend or backend when you can have both? My sweet spot: data. Collecting it, shaping it, using it. Whether at work or in my side projects, I’m always tinkering with new ways to gather and wrangle information.",
    "paragraph2": "I dive into new topics fast and get genuinely excited about what I do (sometimes too excited — ask my teammates). That enthusiasm usually rubs off, and I try to keep things positive, focused, and fun around the dev table.",
    "paragraph3": "Before coding, I was a tutor, a photographer, and even a team lead at the Red Cross. All those roles taught me to see things from different angles — and yes, sometimes to debug people problems before code ones.",
